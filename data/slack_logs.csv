 Bob: Dijkstra's algorithm is an iterative algorithm that provides us with the shortest path from one particular starting node to all other nodes in the graph. To keep track of the total cost from the start node to each destination, we can make use of the distance instance variable in the Vertex class. The algorithm can be implemented in Python using the following code example: 1) Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in shortest path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from the start vertex is calculated and finalized. 2) Initialize all distances as INFINITE and sptSet as empty. 3) Set the distance of the source vertex as 0. 4) While sptSet doesn’t include all vertices: a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has minimum distance value. b) Include u to sptSet. c) Update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if sum of distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance",,1671830683.904159,bob,,,"&gt;Andy: /bob code dijkstra’s algorithm in python

Lucas Adams,lucasgreeneadams,"&gt; GPT-3 certain can do a better job than a lot of the models I created
I don't think that is true in general. We knew how to create very good models that would be better than GPT-3. You would just take the largest LM you could get (we had access to 24-layer XLM-large at the time) and fine tune it while mixing in other non-text features. If we had access to GPT-3 or meta's internal very large 64-layer or whatever models, the process would be the same. These models would be better than an un-finetuned GPT-3. There was a reason why we actually didn't even do this, and instead used comparatively small models like XLM-6 (or even XLM-2!), which was due to the costs of running these models. We made decisions to trade off on accuracy to be under our compute quota. So I don't see how that would be different now, except that generally the compute cost is going down. With the TextRay project that enabled smart caching, we were then able to use the bigger XLM-24 model. However this was still not fine tuned (because that would render the caching useless). So the reason we didn't use something like GPT-3 at the time is pretty much entirely due to cost constraints.

The main place I think we could have used it is in a supervised label generation setup, where GPT-3 would psuedo-label text documents to supplement our manually labelled dataset, or GPT-3 would be used to smartly identify documents that should be labelled. Though again we already somewhat had this capability using our existing models for things like video re-review, Gestalt auto-labelling, Platform for Active Labelling (PAL), ect.",9fffadbc-bb0b-4dd0-ac3f-4e163a80569f,1660662310.865709,general,,Lucas Adams,"&gt; GPT-3 certain can do a better job than a lot of the models I created

Lucas Adams,lucasgreeneadams,"• I am getting a little more skeptical of the ""data moat"" thesis. It was already a bit suspect but the advent of this multi-turn chat beginning to work makes it a lot easier for the underlying centralized models to capture the value of the vertical data on top. I was pretty sure that OpenAI was not using the data coming into and out of it's APIs going to davinci-2 and the like to train models. Mainly because it's still essentially unsupervised and so wouldn't be that much more valuable than the reams of public internet data. But a multi-turn chat product has an implicit signal of quality. By the end of the convo it should be fairly easy to *evaluate* whether the generations produced earlier in the convo were ""good"". This creates a signal for supervised or RL type training. Because evaluation is easier than generation, OpenAI should be able to use LLMs to judge the quality of the generations based on how the convo progresses. So essentially take the case of someone building a Legal Advice product on top of ChatGPT. I believe in that scenario OpenAI would be able to capture a lot of that data moat for themselves. The underlying model should be able to learn from those vertical domain specific convos. Which I don't believe is as much the case for a single input -&gt; output use case of davinci-2

Lucas Adams,lucasgreeneadams,"Generally the strategies are to think in terms of reducing the input, or doing things in a sliding window sort of way, or do a dynamic retrieval.

For example, you want to pass in a news article that is 5 pages long into chatGPT and have it give you a summary, but that's longer than the max context. Instead you pass in each page to chatGPT and have it summarize them independently. Then you pass in the 5 summaries to chatGPT and have it generate an overall summary.

Dynamic retrieval means you execute a query using vector similarity against your partitioned/chunked context. Return top N and then pass that into chatGPT. ChatGPT doesnt give you vectors but the other models do. I believe dynamic retrieval is what chatGPT is doing behind the scenes to refer back to a previous part of the convo (though it's likely more complicated than a simple vector inner product).",a6a90086-41b6-475e-9a3a-15d4233cd12a,1670433071.766949,chat-gpt,,Lucas Adams,"Generally the strategies are to think in terms of reducing the input, or doing things in a sliding window sort of way, or do a dynamic retrieval.

Kevin Merlini,kmerlini,"Andy, potential idea for you with bob: “natural language web scraper”

As a user, I want to grab some information from a set of websites and put into a structured format so I can do something with it.

Example, I want to pull the address, prices, and some other attributes of zillow listing for a given zillow search result

How it works, user types their request into the tool, likely provides some other more structured info like the page(s) to be scraped.

David Braun,braun.david.b,"Many titles of Rick and Morty episodes are combinations of the name ""Rick"" with a popular movie or book title. Can you come up with 10 new episode titles? They should involve cultural references that haven't been used yet.

""Rick vs. the Mummy"" (a reference to the ""Mummy"" film series)

What might happen in Rick of Arabia? I hope that involves lots of aliens and science fiction.
```In ""Rick of Arabia,"" it is possible that Rick and Morty travel to the Middle East, specifically to the Arabian Peninsula, where they encounter various alien species and technology. The episode could involve Rick and Morty getting caught up in local politics or conflicts, and they must find a way to navigate the complex and often dangerous landscape while also dealing with various science fiction elements. They may encounter alien artifacts or technology that have been hidden away for centuries, or encounter alien species that have taken on human form in order to blend in with society. Alternatively, the episode could involve Rick and Morty being transported to an alternate version of the Middle East that is filled with advanced alien technology and futuristic cities, and they must find a way to get back home. Regardless of the specific plot, ""Rick of Arabia"" is likely to be an action-packed and humorous adventure that combines elements of science fiction with the rich culture and history of the Middle East.```",bcbcd777-a517-4721-b71f-ee0e7adb8737,1671384069.708759,random,,David Braun,"Many titles of Rick and Morty episodes are combinations of the name ""Rick"" with a popular movie or book title.
