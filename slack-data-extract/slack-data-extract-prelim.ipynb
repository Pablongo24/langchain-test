For instance, Gates was involved in Microsoft’s discussions earlier this year about a possible partnership with OpenAI, an artificial intelligence startup co-founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, according to two people familiar with the matter. In the discussions, Gates “was very engaged” in scrutinizing OpenAI’s technology. He expressed some skepticism about the startup, which focuses in part on “natural language understanding,” the ability for computers to grasp meaning and context in human speech patterns.\\n&gt; Despite his skepticism, Microsoft in July <https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/|announced a partnership> with OpenAI, under which it made a $1 billion investment in the startup, while OpenAI committed to using Azure, Microsoft’s cloud service. \\n&gt; Gates has expressed his doubts about natural language understanding in other settings, telling attendees at a private event in the Bay Area earlier this year that there had been little meaningful progress in the field over the past half-decade, according to a person who was present at the event. One person familiar with his perspective on OpenAI said Gates admired its technology, but had questions about its business.\\n\\nthis was from 2019, so Gates had an accurate assessment\\n\\nin some sense things only changed in 2020 w/ GPT-3 and scaling laws, which were a large breakthrough\\n\\nHonestly that’s super cool\\n\\nHow can I try it\\n\\n&gt;<@U03TPREG1QQ>: /bob give me: partial fraction decomposition 1/(x^2 + 4x + 3)\\n Bob: The partial fraction decomposition of 1/(x^2 + 4x + 3) is 1/(2 (x + 1)) - 1/(2 (x + 3)).\\n\\nit’s the /bob command on this slack!\\n\\njust a warning that this slack group is mapped to my development branch, so goes down sometimes\\n\\nYeah much easier to be skeptical in 2019 if you weren\\'t deeply involved in the field. \\n\\nThere were already rumblings of what was to come though.
